            <h3 class="text-secondary">Web Development: HTML5 & CSS3</h3>
            <div>I was on my way to begin studies for the CompTIA Network+ Certification ... then I got a bit sidetracked. I accidentally discovered the world of web development... and went crazy. I spent a day researching and decided to learn about Front End Web Development. The beginning point is with HTML and CSS. I am an extremely self motivated individual and decided to take the self study approach. I knew that if I studied hard and built some nice projects, I could save thou$and$ avoiding a bootcamp. I have been following two curriculums and building projects along the way. My sources of study are Free Code Camp and The Odin Project.</div>
