                <h3>Technical Support and Web Development Studies</h3>
                <h6>Process and Progression</h6>
                <p>I caught the bug! December 2021 I became overwhelming fascinated by the world of Technology. I began spending every moment of freetime studying and pursuing advancement in IT support and web development. Seeking a new challenge and a career change, I knew immediately this is what I was looking for. An exciting field that is ever changing and constantly progressing, leaving me with an inifinite source of challenges.</p>

                <h3>Foreman and Technical Tree Removal Specialist</h3>
                <h6>A decade as an Arborist</h6>
                <p>I have learned so much as a manager and foreman. How to relate with customers and enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done and a happy client. However, after 10 years in the industry, the excitement of learning new things and overcoming new challenges has significatly declined. This industry is not like technology, constantly evolving and providing new challenges. Once you remove a tree in a specific scenario 1000 times, the next 1000 are unsurprisingly similiar. This has left me very motivated for a new challege.</p>

                <h3>English Tutor</h3>
                <h6>Language Love</h6>
                <p>It began with Spanish. November 2020, during the lockdown, I found myself with a bit more time on my hands. I dove head first into learning Spanish. It became my escape from the worries, boredom, and other struggles brought by the pandemic. After 3 months of studies and progression, I began to understand the concepts of language learning. A realization that I could also teach my own language came soon after. </p>
